I just did a financial #YearInReview over on Twitter, [head over there](https://twitter.com/rebyn/status/680618650282229760) if you would like to know how I've spent throughout the year.

Here are a few first-s:

I invested (more like surfed) the Viet Nam stock market for the first time, and it wasn't scary at all. In fact, I was fairly surprised at how easy it was to get started. I signed up for an account at [VNDirect](https://vndirect.com.vn), deposited some money into it and made my first orders all in 15 minutes. The whole onboarding experience was so neat I talked most of my friends into doing so just for the sake of seeing how easy it is. I started out modestly with just some dozens of VCB, FPT and ACB. And sold them all a few weeks after (just to feel *dat* feeling of making a profit out of my investment, though shortly). Portfolio yield equaled to around 15% for 2 weeks. Not too bad.
