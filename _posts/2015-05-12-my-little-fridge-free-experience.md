title: My little fridge-free experience.
---

Six months ago, my former landlord kicked me out. Upon moving to a new place, I picked one 'plain' apartment (translation: without any furniture). I thought I would not survive one month without a fridge and would probably resort to buying a mini fridge myself. I was dead wrong. Six months later, I couldn't thank meself more for making that decision.

**Without a fridge**, the foremost benefit would be extra saving. A mini fridge costs about $200 in METRO.

**Without a fridge**, I eat less. Going out in 35*C for lunches isn't my thing, or a sane human's thing. This turns out to be a good thing for me, given I gained 10kgs pre-2015 in a month or two, and have been battling friends' remarks like: *Who are you? Are you Tu? Do you Tu? You're not Tu. You don't Tu.*

**Without a fridge**, I waste less food. I maintained a very unhealthy habbit of going around checking out foods, buying them, stocking them all in the fridge and... leaving them there. Lately I hold a lot of self debates over whether to buy something, as keeping them isn't gonna be durable without a fridge.

**Without a fridge**, one less thing to take along upon moving out.

**Without a fridge**, I can save about a quarter off my monthly electricity bill.

**Without a fridge**, I have to go out to fetch ice and cold drinks. Shops are within 5 minute walk from my place, I usually take this chance to get off a brain crushing task, relax myself a little and put my body to some walking throughout work streaks.

I'd like to conclude my first six months fridge free successful, and will keep on doing it. Let's see how it goes in longer terms.
