I crack awkward jokes when I'm nervous.

My name is Tu Hoang. I'm working at [Bulletproof Networks](http://bulletproof.net.au) in the R&D team. I help maintain the in-house CRM application behind the fleet of instances that Bulletproof helps our clients manage. Lately we've been shifting our focus into debulking the monolithic Rails app to microservices, which so far has yielded a lot of interesting challenges. Part of the reason I set up this blog is to share my findings along the journey.

I've devoted most of my weekends in recent years to building [charity-map.org](http://charity-map.org), a platform for doing charitable work in Viet Nam (we have a crowdfunding site at the front and an API at the back that allows business merchants to be involved with causes).

I'm also into traveling. Lately I've found myself trying to steer away from crowded (yet nevertheless interesting) cities; and expose myself more to nature. I'm planning on a trip to [Ladakh](https://www.flickr.com/groups/47256717@N00/pool/) July 2015 (three weeks); if you happen to be around at that time, let's travel along even for just a few days?

You can find me via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rebyn) or go through my projects on [Github](http://github.com/rebyn).
